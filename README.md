#Autonomous Drone Pathfinding via Deep Reinforcement Learning

Implemented autonomous drone navigation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO) with PyBullet physics engine, achieving 90% success rate in dynamic obstacle avoidance and target acquisition.

Designed a 3D state-space architecture with continuous action mapping, incorporating real-time trajectory optimization and adaptive reward mechanisms for precise spatial control.
